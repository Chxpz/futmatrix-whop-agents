# Overview

This is a production-ready AI agents system with comprehensive REST API and intelligent agent management. The system creates and manages multiple independent AI agents with different personalities and business specializations, each powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o model. The system features a complete REST API architecture using FastAPI for system management and client communication. The system supports two main agent types: an analytical financial advisor agent (Agent Alpha) and a creative content creator agent (Agent Beta). Each agent operates with its own personality traits, business rules, and conversation context management. The system integrates with OpenAI API for intelligent responses and implements comprehensive conversation memory and context awareness.

# System Architecture

## Message Flow Control Architecture
Complete message flow system using RabbitMQ for reliable message queuing between users and agents, Redis for session state management and caching, WebSocket server for real-time bidirectional communication, and FastAPI REST API for system management. The system gracefully degrades to standalone mode when message broker services are unavailable.

## Agent Management Architecture
The system uses a factory pattern to create configurable AI agents with different personalities (analytical, creative, helpful, professional) and business rules (financial_advisor, content_creator, technical_support, general_assistant). Each agent runs independently with its own processing loop and maintains separate state through the AgentState dataclass. Agents are now integrated with message brokers and session managers for production-ready communication.

## Workflow Engine
Built on LangGraph, the workflow system processes user interactions through a structured pipeline: input validation, user notification, business rule processing, RAG retrieval, and response generation. The WorkflowEngine manages the flow between these stages and handles error recovery.

## Message Broker System (RabbitMQ)
Production-ready message queuing with dedicated exchanges (direct, fanout, topic) and queues for user prompts, agent responses, notifications, and system events. Implements message persistence, delivery guarantees, and error handling with message acknowledgments and retry mechanisms.

## Session Management System (Redis)
Redis-based session management for user-agent interactions with configurable TTL, message history tracking, user/agent session indexing, and automatic cleanup of expired sessions. Supports session context persistence and real-time state updates.

## WebSocket Communication Server
Real-time bidirectional communication server supporting user connections, agent subscriptions, message broadcasting, and connection management. Handles authentication, ping/pong heartbeat, and automatic connection cleanup with comprehensive error handling.

## REST API System (FastAPI)
Complete API management system with endpoints for session creation/management, message sending, agent status monitoring, and health checks. Features CORS support, comprehensive error handling, and integration with all message flow components.

## Personality System
The PersonalityManager defines distinct agent behaviors through traits, response templates, and processing styles. Personalities include analytical (data-driven), creative (innovative), helpful (service-oriented), and professional (business-focused) approaches, each with specific tone and communication patterns.

## Business Rules Engine
A rule-based system that applies domain-specific logic based on agent specialization. Rules include financial compliance for advisor agents, content moderation for creator agents, and specialized processing logic for different business domains.

## Data Persistence Layer
Uses PostgreSQL/Supabase with agent-specific schema architecture. Each agent has its own dedicated database schema (agent_alpha, agent_beta) with business-specific tables, while shared data lives in the public schema. Features connection management, query optimization, data validation through Pydantic schemas, and automated table creation based on business rules. Stores user interactions, agent responses, and system metadata with proper error handling and connection pooling.

## RAG Knowledge System
Implements document ingestion, vector search, and context retrieval for enhanced agent responses. Integrates with the database for document storage and uses content hashing for deduplication and efficient retrieval.

## MCP Integration
Connects to external MCP servers for tool integration and extended capabilities. Manages multiple server connections with health checks, authentication, and failover mechanisms for reliable external service integration.

## Configuration Management
Environment-based configuration system that handles database credentials, API keys, server endpoints, message broker URLs, and operational parameters. Supports different deployment environments with secure credential management.

## Error Handling System
Comprehensive exception hierarchy with structured error reporting, logging, and recovery mechanisms. Custom exceptions for different system components including message broker, session management, and WebSocket errors with detailed error context and debugging information.
