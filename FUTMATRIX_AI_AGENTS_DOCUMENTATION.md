# Futmatrix AI Agents Layer - Complete Documentation
**Version 1.0.0 - LangGraph Implementation**

## Overview

This repository implements the **AI Agents Layer** for the Futmatrix competitive gaming platform. It provides two specialized LangGraph-based AI agents designed for EA Sports FC 25 competitive gaming:

- **Coach Agent**: Performance analysis, training plan management, and personalized coaching
- **Rivalizer Agent**: Intelligent matchmaking, opponent suggestions, and competitive coordination

## Architecture Overview

### System Integration
The AI Agents Layer sits within the broader Futmatrix ecosystem and integrates with:
- **Supabase Database**: Player data, match history, performance metrics
- **Discord Bot**: User interactions and notifications
- **Web Platform**: Dashboard data and user interface
- **Smart Contracts**: Token rewards, penalties, and staking mechanisms
- **Microservices**: Match processing, OCR analysis, ranking computation

### Technology Stack
- **LangGraph**: State-based agent orchestration and workflow management
- **OpenAI GPT-4o**: Advanced language model for intelligent responses
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL database with real-time capabilities
- **FastAPI**: Production-ready API server with comprehensive security
- **Python 3.11+**: Modern Python with async/await support

## Agent Specifications

### Coach Agent (LangGraph Implementation)

**Purpose**: Analyze player performance and provide personalized coaching advice

**Input**: `user_id` and optional coaching request message

**Tools**:
- **Supabase DB Query Tool**: Fetch last 5 matches with performance metrics
- **Metrics Analyzer Tool**: Compute performance trends and consistency
- **Training Plan Tool**: Generate or update personalized training plans

**Workflow Nodes**:
1. `analyze_user` - Fetch and analyze recent performance data
2. `generate_response` - Create personalized coaching advice
3. `update_training_plan` - Create/update training plans based on analysis
4. `log_interaction` - Record coaching session in database

**Decision Logic**:
- **No recent matches**: Suggest playing matches to generate data
- **Below performance threshold**: Adjust training plan with focus areas
- **Consistent progress**: Increase challenge level and issue token rewards
- **Declining performance**: Create intensive improvement plan

**Output**: Performance summary, coaching advice, updated training goals, token recommendations

### Rivalizer Agent (LangGraph Implementation)

**Purpose**: Facilitate competitive matchmaking and opponent suggestions

**Input**: `user_id` and optional matchmaking preferences

**Tools**:
- **Supabase DB Tool**: Access match history and user statistics
- **Matchmaking Tool**: Query `rivalizer_matchmaking_view` for eligible opponents
- **Discord + Platform Integration Tool**: Send match invites and notifications
- **Smart Contract Trigger Tool**: Handle staking and payout mechanisms

**Workflow Nodes**:
1. `find_opponents` - Identify eligible opponents based on skill level
2. `rank_matches` - Score potential matches using multiple factors
3. `generate_suggestions` - Create compelling match descriptions
4. `log_interaction` - Record matchmaking activity

**Matchmaking Algorithm**:
- **Performance Matching**: Â±1.5 performance points for competitive balance
- **Experience Weighting**: Similar match counts preferred
- **Recency Bonus**: Recently active players prioritized
- **Avoid Repeats**: Filter out recent opponents (7-day window)

**Output**: 3 ranked opponent suggestions with strategic insights and booking options

## Database Integration

### Core Tables Used
- `users` - Player profiles and authentication data
- `user_stats_summary` - Aggregated performance metrics
- `matches` - Individual match records with detailed stats
- `processed_metrics` - Computed performance indicators
- `training_plans` - Coach-generated training programs
- `agent_interactions` - Complete log of AI agent activities

### Specialized Views
- `coach_user_view` - Optimized data for coaching analysis
- `rivalizer_matchmaking_view` - Pre-filtered matchmaking candidates

### Performance Metrics
The agents analyze comprehensive performance data:
- **Shot Efficiency**: Goal conversion and accuracy
- **Pass Efficiency**: Passing accuracy and possession control
- **Defensive Efficiency**: Tackling success and positioning
- **Overall Performance**: Weighted composite score (0-10 scale)
- **Consistency Score**: Performance variance measurement

## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints (No Authentication)
- `GET /` - System information and status
- `GET /health` - Comprehensive health check with metrics
- `GET /agents` - Available agents and capabilities
- `GET /system/stats` - Detailed system statistics
- `GET /docs` - Interactive API documentation

### Protected Endpoints (Require API Key)
- `POST /coach/analyze` - Request coaching analysis and advice
- `POST /rivalizer/matchmake` - Find competitive match opponents

### Authentication
- **API Key Format**: `Authorization: Bearer your_api_key`
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests per minute per IP
- **Security Headers**: XSS/CSRF protection enabled

## Training Plan System

### Coach Agent Training Plans
The Coach Agent creates dynamic 4-week training programs based on performance analysis:

**Stake Mechanism**:
- Players stake tokens on their commitment to the training plan
- Success: Receive stake back + 20% bonus
- Failure: Partial or full stake slash (sent to treasury)

**Weekly Checkpoints**:
```json
{
  "week_1": {
    "matches_required": 3,
    "performance_target": 7.2,
    "focus_areas": ["finishing", "defensive_positioning"],
    "bonus_objectives": ["Score 5+ goals", "Keep clean sheet"]
  }
}
```

**Focus Areas Based on Performance**:
- **Declining**: Fundamentals (finishing, defense, game management)
- **Improving**: Advanced tactics (skill moves, pressure management)
- **Stable**: Consistency (fitness, mental preparation)

## Matchmaking Intelligence

### Rivalizer Agent Matchmaking
The Rivalizer Agent uses a sophisticated scoring system for opponent selection:

**Match Quality Score** (0-10 scale):
- **Performance Score** (40%): Skill level compatibility
- **Recency Score** (30%): Recent activity bonus
- **Experience Score** (20%): Similar match count preference
- **Win Rate Score** (10%): Balanced competition level

**Competitiveness Classification**:
- `very_even` (< 0.5 performance difference)
- `competitive` (0.5-1.0 difference)
- `slight_advantage` (1.0-1.5 difference)
- `challenging` (> 1.5 difference)

**Anti-Repetition Logic**:
- 7-day cooldown period for recent opponents
- Preference for new matchups to maintain engagement
